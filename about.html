                            <span class="heading">The technology and I</span><br> I started learn to code at least a 3
                            years ago with Python language. In all this time, i learned about Object Oriented
                            Programming and Graphic User Interfaces with PyQt5. I developed a automate payroll managment
                            system that can handle at five thousand emploees in an hour. By this software, i started to
                            have a big interest in big data and machine learning, so i created a virtual assistant
                            called: Jenny. This assistant is in alpha at the moment because i need to learn more about
                            speech recognition but im on it. <br>

                            I had my first computer at the age of 7, with linux installed by default. Dont remember what
                            distro, but i remember clearly something: a black screen with white letters. I enjoyed
                            sitting in front of it and press all the keys in the keyboard<br>

                            By the moment, i still learning code by my self but recently i enrolled in Holberton School
                            to deep more in my knowlegment about IT. <br>

                            Youtube. My recent interest in web development start on YouTube when i saw how to create a
                            desktop application using HTML, CSS, Javascript with Electron and Python to make a wheather
                            app. <br>
                            Web Development always attracted me but never deep dive into it. When i started with this

                            visual and i really like create nice GUIs. <br>
                            I have more interests after videogames and technology. I really like series and i have a lot
